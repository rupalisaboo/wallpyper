# Wall-PY-per
A Python script for creating a wallpaper slideshow

## Usage
Running the script for the first time will create a default config file. Change the config file as you see fit.


Unfortunately, This script will only work with desktops using Dconf. I plan to port this script to other desktops/OS's in the future.
